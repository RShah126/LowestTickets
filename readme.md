<h2>About</h2>
  A website that allows you to display up to the past 5 titles and date released movies information based on your movie search. I may add more.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
I was bored, I hadn't done a project in a while so I decided to do this one, it sounded interesting.

<h2>Notes</h2>
I have not uploaded the API key, because I do not want it to be used.
